# quadruped robot
This repo consists of the code and CAD models used in the making of a box-shaped walking robot
that disguises itself as a Christmas present.

The code in this repo consists of Arduino sketches used to actuate the servo motors, as well as simulation
scripts that are more generalizable to other quadruped robots for running inverse kinematics.
